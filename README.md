## Dependencies
**GLISHCAT** is a Python application, and needs Python installed on your machine. On Windows, to check if Python is installed, open a command prompt and type:

If Python is installed it will show you the version number, otherwise please install Python for Windows by following [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). 

**GLISHCAT**'s Python code depends on two third-party libraries, [Tkinter](https://www.tcl.tk/) and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org). Tkinter should be installed when you install Python, and you can check if it is by running:

    py -m tkinter
    
To install pygame you will need [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed, Python's package manager. To check whether pip is installed, and to automatically install it if it isn't, you can run:

    py -m ensurepip
    
Once installed, you can install pygame with:

    pip install pygame
